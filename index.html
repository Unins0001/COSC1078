      <br>
      I am a 20 year old design student, born in the Philippines and moved to Australia in 2011, studying IT for the semester. I love to play video games on PC, have terrible hairstyles, express myself and submit to capitalism. I chose to study at RMIT University after being referred to by my previous instructors. Being one of the top schools for design in the southern hemisphere, I was inclined to enrol and was very privileged to to attend such a prestigious university in a bustling city of art and culture; the location and activities found in Melbourne CBD also help to increase the appeal. I chose to study Information Technology this semester as I have always been interested in computers and programming, having taken every computing class available through all stages of my education, but have been too intimidated to commit to Computer Science courses.

    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>

      <p class="inset">
      Since my early childhood I have always been interested in technology and video games, with my first piece of technology being a PSP in 2007. Having spent my formative years escaping into the internet and playing video games, I had always dreamed of one day becoming a part of a game studio. Art and technology have been core parts of my identity for as long as I could remember. From my early fascination with art and drawing to create worlds and lore to my dabbling in programming and creative software, I have always felt I could play god and manifest not just great art but art that moves and interacts with its users. In recent years I have spent the majority of my spare time designing my own websites and developing mods for games. I have always had a passion for programming and art and would love to settle into a career that marries both aspects.

  <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
  <p>I enjoy art and design and to be able to push my own work into more feasible, interactive, and somewhat living entities have always given me incredible doses of serotonin. To be able to create real worlds, characters and lore to essentialy ‘play god’. Hence why I have always been drawn to game design and conceptual artwork.  User experience design is also another specialty I am interested in, as someone who is very much all about presentation and self expression. As mentioned previously, a job that marries design and technology would constitute my ideal career. Though these careers can be quite challenging, when there is no real way to put value on artwork, to work around this I would have to develop my own portfolio in order to showcase my skills and effectively sell them to potential employers. <br>

  <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
  <p>
    “All that is gold does not glitter; not all those who wander are lost; the old that is strong does not wither; deep roots are not reached by the frost.”
<br>
<br>
    Although they may seem quiet or unassuming, Mediators (INFPs) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity – Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them.
<br>
<br>
    INFPs are empathetic, generous, open minded, creative, passionate and idealistic. I have always found that when working with teams I often tend to play a more supportive role, opting to agree and obey as opposed to directing and delegating tasks and orders. I have always approached work with a visual lens first, deciding on the visual context and elements of an assignment; even in text based work where I would focus on the narrative tone and presentation of my words. Unrealistic, self isolating, unfocused, emotionally vulnerable and self critical are INFPs weaknesses. Though these findings felt like an attack on my personality, I found genuine truth in these weaknesses as they directly correlate with INFP strengths. They all seem to point towards indecisiveness, self deprecation and desperate need to please of which I can very much relate to. When working with others I often end up speaking last and the least, instead preferring to listen to others and taking account of their ideas, direction and motivation; overwriting my own which can lead to self doubt when overwhelmed by what others would think of me and my work in an attempt to please.

    Preferred learning styles are the way in which individuals learn best with three main learning styles often identified in students including auditory, visual, tactile/kinesthetic. Visual learners learn best when information is presented in a written language format or in another visual format such as pictures or diagrams. As a visual learner I learn best from written information and visualising to recall said information; graphical elements such as colour coordination, symbols and diagrams also aid in instruction. When working in a team, conceptualising ideas and brainstorming with moodboards, word clouds and mind maps can help me better understand the work and my task at hand. Data and information management should be presented in organised notes or colour coordinated spreadsheets for efficient legibility.

    Upon receiving an IQ score of 120, placing myself on the top 6.7 percentile of test takers on the dot. Upon researching the means behind these scores, I have gathered that I have ‘superior’ intelligence and would fit the occupational role of educators, pharmacists, accountants, nurses and managers. While serving as an ego boost, these scores mean little to nothing beyond that. It is also necessary to be cautious when using descriptive classifications of IQ, for it is at its best a rough measure of academic intelligence. All of which failing to take account of social elements such as home, school, and community. When working in teams it is best to assess each members personal strengths and weaknesses, to remedy them accordingly instead of relying on preconceived notions of intelligence; which could subsequently lead to uneven workload and non beneficial output.

    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    <p class="outset">

      My project idea revolves around the use of speech enhancement and spatial audio. The idea is to create an app or software that marries the speech enhancement feature of Google Pixel phones with spatial audio in VR. In the hopes of creating a sort of hearing/learning aid for people with hearing disabilities as well as individuals with focus/attention disorders. By incorporating sound isolation with a visual technology such as google class. <br>

      Attention Deficit Disorder is a neurological impairment characterised by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Individuals may be diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Learning, social and emotional problems can co-occur with ADHD. Said individuals may appear easily distracted, disorganised, and lose things frequently. Employment, relationships, and other life areas may be affected by attention deficits and associated difficulties. A diagnosis of ADD or ADHD is typically made by psychoeducational or medical professionals following a comprehensive evaluation. <br>
    <br>
      Attention deficits may impact a student in a variety of academic activities such as lectures, discussions, test taking, writing assignments, or fieldwork. Some students with ADHD will need academic accommodations to succeed in academic pursuits. For example, a student with ADHD might need to tape record lectures to review information that might be missed in written notes, or he might need a quiet room to eliminate distractions during a test. <br>
    <br>
      Research by Adam Budde, project lead of the acoustic camera at Hauni suggests  machines that are too loud are annoying; producing irritating noises as they are not optimally adjusted during assembly. Using an acoustic camera to identify the sources of irritating noises by means of digital technology. In turn helping to find and eliminate unexpected sources of noise. <br>
    <br>
      The acoustic camera system enables the sources of irritating noises to be made visible in photos or videos so that they can be precisely localised. Though the camera does not film images. Instead, it uses sensors to measure the soundwaves that it emits. <br>
    <br>
      This is done through real-time measurement using thirty microphones, enabling the camera to pinpoint the noise source with greater accuracy than the human ear could. In order to achieve this, thirty directional microphones are arranged in an array. Taking advantage of the fact that sound travels at different speeds from its source to each of the thirty microphones. With these delays enabling them to calculate the angle of which the soundwaves are coming from, thus determining the location of the sound source. Using this information, the camera’s software then makes the location of the loudest noise visible in a video. In short, the camera combines sound and images. It’s a simple principle that is complicated to implement but produces excellent results. <br>
    <br>
      The method’s biggest advantage is that conventionally pinpointing noise sources by means of sound field mapping requires individual measurements to be made at different times. The acoustic camera, by contrast, makes it possible to localise the noise source more quickly and to visualise it in real time. The resulting videos also enable processes that change over time to be examined easily and quickly. <br>
    <br>
      The human brain interprets auditory signals in a specific way that allows it to make decisions about its surrounding environment. We use our two ears, in conjunction with the ability to move our heads in space, to make better decisions about the position of an audio signal and the environment the sound is in. <br>
    <br>
      Spatial audio in virtual reality involves the manipulation of audio signals so they mimic acoustic behaviour in the real world. An accurate sonic representation of a virtual world is a very powerful way to create a compelling and immersive experience. Spatial audio not only serves as a mechanism to complete the immersion but is also very effective as a UI element: audio cues can call attention to various focal points in a narrative or draw the user into watching specific parts of a 360 video. <br>
    <br>
      While the playback and consumption of spatial audio is the same regardless of whether the experience is an interactive experience, 360 video, or a cinematic mixed reality piece, the workflow to create such content is significantly different. In particular, games and interactive experiences often rely on audio samples played from discrete sound sources that are mixed in real time relative to the position of the camera. The Oculus Audio SDK is designed to add high-quality spatialization tools to existing tools of; FMOD and Wwise; and engines, Unity and Unreal; often used by game developers. <br>
    <br>
      Thanks to the growth of production and consumption of immersive panoramic or VR experiences, developers and infrastructure owners are re-examining the constraints of video container specifications. Better file compression, codec and streaming infrastructure support for multichannel spatial audio, or, support of various real-time interactive metadata elements to influence traditional video playback or social reactions with live video are examples of a trend which is proof of the worlds of traditional video broadcasting and siloed game-like apps coming together. <br>
    <br>
      Ambisonic technology is a method to render 3D sound fields in a spherical format around a particular point in space. It is conceptually similar to 360 video except the entire spherical sound field is audible and responds to changes in head rotation. There are many ways of rendering to an Ambisonic field, but all of them rely on decoding to a binaural stereo output to allow the user to perceive the spatial audio effect over a normal pair of headphones. <br>
    <br>
      Ambisonic audio itself can be of n- orders comprising various channels. More channels results in higher spatial quality, although there is a limit to the perceived difference in sound quality as one goes beyond 3rd order Ambisonics (16 channels of audio). Regardless of the number of channels used for encoding the original signal, the decoded binaural audio output will always be to two channels. As the listener moves their head the content of the decoded output stream shifts and changes accordingly, providing a 3D spatial effect. <br>
    <br>
      Google has launched a speech enhancement option for their phone cameras which enable users to reduce background noise in their video clips, putting more emphasis on the main subject. By training the model on a large-scale collection of online videos, they are able to capture correlations between speech and visual signals, such as mouth movements and facial expressions, which can then be used to separate the speech of one person from another, whilst simultaneously separating speech from background sounds. Beyond achieving state-of-the-art results in speech separation this new technology in particular improves on audio-only processing when there are multiple people speaking. As visual cues in the video help determine who is saying what in order to reduce unwanted noises like “wind, traffic, and crowds”. <br>
    <br>
      My project outcome will be an application for a new piece of technology that marries functions of VR’s ambisonics and google’s speech enhancement feature, with the acoustic camera’s structure as a foundation. By pairing the functionality of speech enhancement, to identify and eliminate background noise, with the thirty camera noise identification of the acoustic camera, to locate and identify the main sound focus; paired with a visual device similar to glasses or a headset with a video camera; akin to VR headsets, to allow for eyetracking in order to find visual cues for speech enhancement.  The product can then be managed on a dedicated app for mobile devices to adjust for sound focus and modes in order to aid individuals with attention and hearing difficulties such as those with ADD and ADHD. Features including heatmaps and eyetracking calibration. <br>
